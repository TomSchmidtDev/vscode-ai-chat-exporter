# AI Chat Exporter

> [Deutsche Version](README.de.md)

A VS Code extension that lets you export your **GitHub Copilot Chat history** to Markdown or styled HTML — directly from your editor.

## Features

- **Two-panel sidebar** — sessions list on the left, message preview on the right
- **Search across sessions and messages** — filter with `AND`, `OR`, `"exact phrases"` and parentheses; matching sessions show a hit-count badge and hits are highlighted in message previews, with Prompts / Responses / Title scope toggles
- **Current-workspace filter** — shows only the sessions for your active workspace by default; toggle **All WS** to see sessions from every workspace
- **Empty-window sessions** — sessions created without an open workspace folder are included in the All WS view
- **Select individual messages** per session for partial exports
- **Toggle Prompt / Copilot messages** to include or exclude each role from the export
- **Single-session Save As dialog** — when exporting one session, a file picker with a pre-filled filename opens; for multiple sessions, a folder picker is shown
- **Export to Markdown** (`.md`) — clean, portable, paste-ready
- **Export to HTML** (`.html`) — fully styled with syntax-highlighted code blocks
- **10 built-in color themes** for HTML output: Catppuccin Mocha, GitHub Dark, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night, One Dark, Monokai Pro, Material Ocean, Solarized Dark, Light Classic
- **Custom color profile** — configure all HTML colors individually via VS Code settings
- **Internationalization** — UI and export content in English or German; follows VS Code's display language automatically, or set it manually
- **Read-only access** — your Copilot chat data is never modified

## Installation

### Via VS Code Marketplace

1. Open VS Code
2. Go to **Extensions** (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`)
3. Search for **AI Chat Exporter**
4. Click **Install**

### Manual installation from VSIX

1. Download the `.vsix` file from the [Releases](https://github.com/TomSchmidtDev/vscode-ai-chat-exporter/releases) page
2. In VS Code, open the Extensions panel
3. Click the `···` menu → **Install from VSIX…**
4. Select the downloaded file

## Usage

1. Click the **AI Chat Exporter** icon in the Activity Bar (left sidebar)
2. The left panel shows all GitHub Copilot chat sessions for the current workspace
3. Click **All WS** to switch to a view showing sessions from all workspaces
4. Click a session to preview its messages in the right panel
5. Use the search box above the session list to find sessions and messages — words combine with AND, supports `OR`, `"exact phrases"` and parentheses; the **Prompts** / **Responses** / **Title** checkboxes control where to search
6. Select sessions for export using the checkboxes; use **All** / **None** to select all or none
7. Optionally toggle the **Prompt** / **Copilot** buttons to include or exclude each message role

## Requirements

- VS Code 1.85 or later
- GitHub Copilot extension installed and at least one chat session recorded

## How It Works

The extension reads GitHub Copilot Chat sessions from VS Code's local workspace storage (typically under `~/.config/Code/User/workspaceStorage` on Linux, `~/Library/Application Support/Code/User/workspaceStorage` on macOS, or `%APPDATA%\Code\User\workspaceStorage` on Windows). No network requests are made.

The current workspace is identified via VS Code's own storage hash, ensuring an exact match with what Copilot Chat itself displays — no URI matching or path guessing required.

## Privacy

This extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. All operations are performed locally on your machine. No telemetry, analytics, or network requests are made beyond what VS Code itself performs.
